RBergomi option pricing

### What is this repository for? ###

This is a C++ implementation of European option pricing routines in the RBergomi model.

* Pricing is done by Monte Carlo
* fBm is generated by the hybrid scheme
* At the moment, only constant forward variance is implemented.

### Build instructions ###

The projects are prepared in eclipse, but in any case these are requirements for compiling and running the code:

* fftw3 library

* openmp support

* C++14

The code was found to compile and run successfully with g++ version 5.x and later, but not with a tested version of g++ 4.??. 

Note that I was not able to compile the RBergomi package for R (using Rcpp) in OSX, while I was able to do so in Linux. A workaround is provided by simply calling a console program from within R.
